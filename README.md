CS230 Operating Platforms Project One and Software Design Template

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

My client, The Gaming Room, wanted to develop a web-based game that served multiple platforms based on their current game, which has been only deployed as an Android app only. They needed help setting up the environment, in addition to streamlining development of a web-based version of the application. This software had to be able to implement basic design patterns, in addition to having the players join different teams, and connect cross-platform.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think what I have done particularly well in the development of this documentation is the attention to detail in the different questions asked in the document. In addition to that, I think that this attention to detail really allows us to understand exactly what it is that the customer wants so we can take into account all of the different types of possible issues we may have, in addition to how many different features and functions we should implement within the application.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I think that working through the design document really helped me reiterate through the information given by the client in order to really take into account for everything they had wanted. Attention to detail is incredibly important, and the first time I read through the documentation, I had not noticed that the application was already deployed as an android application, but when I read through it a second time, I read that detail and was able to account for that within the next version of my design document.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think that when it comes to working on design documents, it is definitely not my first strength as I find it challenging to take all of my thoughts, and organize them onto paper. Though I think that persevering through this document really helps show the revisions needed within the documentation. For example, I think there are much better ways to implement an answer to a client about cross-platform deployment by focusing on a few methods of deployment, apart from the in-depth consideration of every different type of computer we are able to use, in addition to their benefits and defects. Perhaps when setting up a department, this is important, but if the department is already set up, we can focus on the methods of success that are outlined for us already which may help us find the best solution in a quicker manner.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It is incredibly important to consider the user's needs when designing because when you are designing a program without that consideration, your client's application will not be user friendly. At the end of the day, if it is not easy for the user, then they will not use it. I think that there is a balance between usability, and complexity as sometimes complexity is needed and not everything needs to be simple. Though when implementing an application for users to use, we need to focus on the scope of the application, and what does need to be easy so we can make the app enjoyable to use.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I think that the most important part of designing software is incrementally designing each part within the architecture of the application. When incrementally designing, you are able to focus and fine tune each part with the most cohesive type of perception, because your mind will not be cluttered with unneccesary details making the application architecture worse in the long run. This way you can also seperate each of the functions, and program them one by one, to make the code itself the best it can be.
